    we can then perform the first round of rays intersection
    using the romulus cache

    this load of intersections is retrieved, and populated back into
    romulus. Shader invocations are retireved and populated into reamus

    shaders are executed, results retreived and put into reamus, new shaders
    spawned (populated into romulus), and the fragments executed (at this point)
    frame texels are retrievable.
